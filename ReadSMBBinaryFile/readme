SMB binary file:

| header | first image| header | second image | header | ...

A smb file is an array of image data.
Every image has a header which is 20 bytes and comes before image data as follow:

//SMBHeader = 20 Bytes
struct SMBHeader
{
    uint32 SMB
    uint8  dataType
    uint8  numberColors
    uint16 typePad
    uint32 compression
    uint32 width
    uint32 height
}

ROI data is a part of image data (starts from first pixel in the first row)
After the header we have saved the requested information (ROI data) as follow:

// Roi Data = 44 bytes:
struct RoiData
{
    uint32 cameraIndex;
    uint64 framenumber;
    uint64 timeStamp;
    uint32 boundingbox_left;
    uint32 boundingbox_top;
    uint32 boundingbox_width;
    uint32 boundingbox_height;
    double camera_angle;
}
